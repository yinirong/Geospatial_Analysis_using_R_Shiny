# COVID-19 Impact on Airport Traffic in the U.S.

This dynamic dashboard shows COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths against airport traffic across major cities in the U.S. The data collected spans from March through December 2020. 

The metrics used in the dashboard are as follows
- **Airport Traffic Index**: this represents daily airport traffic volume compared to that during the period from February 1 to March 15 in 2020 (baseline period)
- **Fatality Rate**: this estimates the proportion of deaths among all confirmed cases

The dashboard illustrates an unprecedented shift in travel patterns, highlighting a staggering 50% plunge in airport traffic while major cities grappling with surging confirmed COVID-19 cases. We can also witness a turning point in August 2023 as vaccine availability drived a resurgence in airport activity and a decline in fatality rates.
